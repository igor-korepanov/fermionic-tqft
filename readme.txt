Here are three files for wxMaxima computer algebra system. They belong to the paper:

Free fermions on a piecewise linear four-manifold. II: Pachner moves,

by Igor G. Korepanov,

and their aim is to provide numerical evidence in support of the algebraic Conjecture in the mentioned paper.

Files "formulas.wxmx" and "numerical_check.wxmx" can be read and modified by a human using wxMaxima.

File "formulas.wxmx" generates necessary algebraic expressions and writes them into the file "LR". This may take ten minutes or more, so the file "LR" generated this way is already here.

File "numerical_check.wxmx" assigns (pseudo)random values to the independent variables and checks the desired identity for these values. You may play of course with assigning other values.

Further explanations are included in these two files.

File "LR" is for storing long algebraic expressions, it has been created by "formulas.wxmx" and can be used by "numerical_check.wxmx".
